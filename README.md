# list-contacts
Write your contacts in Google to a Google Spreadsheet by using Google Apps Script

Hello! This is my first code in Github.
This short code allows you to get a list of your contacts from Google Contacts and write it to a spreadsheet.

All you need is:
- to copy the code,
- to create a spreadsheet in Google Sheets,
- to click Tools > Script editor,
- to clear the code page,
- to paste the code and save it,
- to run the code.

That is all. 

p.s. Google will request you one time only to authorize the code to access to your contacts and spreadsheets. This is because you are who wrote the code and Google does not warrant that the code is secure.
